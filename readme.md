This application interfaces with a database and allowes for Add/Delete and update operations that also changes the entries in the mySQL database. 
The client for this application gave us multiple spreadsheets that needed to be put into this database such that the clients can edit the database easily.
This project was made with another partner. I mainly worked on the server-side code and making the endpoints along with making the Login screen. I also worked on the entire
sort functionality of the project and helped out with the frontend.
